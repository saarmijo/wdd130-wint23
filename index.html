        <p>I love to hang out with friends and family, as well as reading. I was born and raised in Chile, and moved to Illinois when I was 8 years old. I am not married, nor do I have any children, but I do have 9 nieces and nephews. My grandma was the one who turned our family to the church, and so therefore I was born into it, and I am so glad I was. One of my favorite quotes from a general authority is by Ronald A. Rasband, "Allow (the Lord) to make more of you than you can make of yourself on your own. Treasure His involvement." This quote has helped me through most of highschool and I will continue to use it through college as well.</p>    
        <p class="room">My major is Computer Science. I am interested in taking this class because I want to explore all the different aspects of Computer Science in order to find which one I like the best.</p>
