          Dino World is the one website stop to get all the information you need about the giant animals that came thousands of years before us. With the interactive timeline, there is no better place to easily navigate the three dinosaur ages, in a fun and simple way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dinosaurs lived over three long periods in time in the Mesozoic era. They lived from 252-66 million years ago. That is 186 years of dinosaurs in this Earth’s history! That also means that there is a lot of history to cover, and some still to uncover!

      </ul>
      <h3>Triassic</h3>
        <p>
          The Triassic period was 252-201 million years ago. This period is also known as the ‘Age of Reptiles.’ During this time on Earth, all of the continents were squished together in one super continent called Pangea. Dinosaurs during the Triassic period were a lot smaller than the ones we see in movies now, but they were the start of something big. Some popular dinosaurs from this period include: Pantydracos, Saturnalias, Daemonosaurus, and Eoraptors.
        </p>
      <h4>Pantydraco</h4>
        <p>
          Pantydraco’s name comes from the Welsh word Pant-y-ffynnon, which means well / spring, and draco, which means dragon.
          Where found: Bonvilston in South Wales, UK
          Estimated length: 3 m (10 ft.)
        </p>
      <h4>Saturnalia</h4>
        <p>
          One of the earliest known dinosaurs, as well as one of the earliest known ‘plant eating’ dinosaurs.
          Where found: Santa Maria Formation, southern Brazil; Pebbly Arkose Formation,	 
          Zimbabwe
          Estimated length: 1.5 m (5ft.)
        </p>
      <h4>Daemonosaurus</h4>
        <p>
          This unusual-looking dinosaur had large eyes and a short, blunt snout with protruding teeth.
	        Where found: Ghost Ranch, Chinle Formation, New Mexico
          Estimated length: 1.5-2.2 m (5-7ft.)
        </p>
      <h4>Eoraptor</h4>
        <p>
          This was one of the first ever dinosaurs to have evolve.	
          Where found: Argentina
          Estimated length: 1 m (3.25 ft.)
        </p>
      <h3>Jurassic</h3>
        <p>
          The Jurassic period was 201.3–145.0 million years ago. During this period, the supercontinent Pangea split apart. Dinosaurs during this period begin to get bigger. This was a golden time for dinosaurs. Some popular dinosaurs from this time period include: Brachiosaurus, Megalosaurus, Archaeopteryx, and Stegosaurus.
        </p>
      <h4>Brachiosaurus</h4>
        <p>
          With a long neck and tail, and an enormous body supported by four tree-trunk-like legs, is a true giant.
	        Where found: Colorado, USA
          Estimated length: 18-21 m (59-69 ft.)
        </p>
      <h4>Megalosaurus</h4>
        <p>
          First ever dinosaur to be named. It walked on its hind legs, and used its tail as a counterbalance.
          Where found: England, possibly France
          Estimated length: 9 m (30 ft.)
        </p>
      <h4>Archaeopteryx</h4>
        <p>
          This dinosaur was a mix between bird and dinosaur. With dinosaur characteristics such as teeth, clawed wings and tails, as well as bird traits such as a wishbone and flight feathers, scientists are unsure whether this dinosaur was capable of true flapping flight, or just sophisticated gliding.
          Where found: Bavaria, southern Germany
          Estimated length: 0.5 m (20 in.)
        </p>
      <h4>Stegosaurus</h4>
        <p>
          This plant eater had forelegs longer than its hindlegs, giving it a downward slant. The most distinctive feature of the Stegosaurus is the two rows of large plates that run along its back. These may have been used as a defense against predators, or as a means of controlling the animal’s body heat.
	        Where found: Morrison Formation, western US
          Estimated length: 9 m (30 ft.)

      </ul>
      <h3>Cretaceous</h3>
        <p>
          The Cretaceous period was 145.5 and 65.5 million years ago. This is the last and final time period for dinosaurs. This is the time period when dinosaurs experience a mass extinction. This was the longest period of the Mesozoic era, it lasted 79 million years. Some popular dinosaurs from this time period include the Velociraptor, Giganotosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, and the Triceratops. 
        </p>
      <h4>Velociraptor</h4>
        <p>
          Unlike in the Jurassic Park movies, the velociraptor was not in fact taller than a man, it was turkey sized. It walked on its hind legs, and had feathers.
          Where found: Mongolia, China
          Estimated length: 07 m (6.8 ft.)
        </p>
      <h4>Giganotosaurus</h4>
        <p>
          This dinosaur is at competition with the Spinosaurus for the position of ‘biggest land predator.’ Its skull was even bigger than the T-rex. 
          Where found: Argentina
          Estimated length: 12-15 m (39-49.5 ft.)
        </p>
      <h4>Tyrannosaurus</h4>
        <p>
          One of the best known dinosaurs, it had what is estimated to be the greatest bite force of all land animals.
          Where found: Western USA
          Estimated length: 12 m (39 ft.)
        </p>
      <h4>Triceratops</h4>
        <p>
          This dinosaur had two large horns on top of its head and a third horn above its snout. 
          Where found: North America
          Estimated length: 9 m (30 ft.)
